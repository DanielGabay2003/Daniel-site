        I have many hobbies – the greatest, most meaningful, and important one is Torah study.<br>
        Below, I’ll tell you about it, as well as other hobbies of mine such as sports and gaming.

	<h2 id="torah-study">Torah study</h2>
	<p>
	 Beyond the fact that observing the Torah and commandments is my way of life, Torah study itself is very important to me, as it is essential to my lifestyle.<br> As the saying goes: "גדול תלמוד שמביא לידי מעשה"
        Throughout my adult years, especially during my time in yeshiva, Torah study has played a major role in my life.<br> Even today, I enjoy learning Torah, expanding and deepening my knowledge in Torah, Halacha, ethics, and more.<br>
        All of this is in addition to the fact that the study itself is a great and significant mitzvah.

	<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
	<p>
	 In my free time, I enjoy playing, watching, and being involved in sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, and more.<br> These activities help me feel better overall, and of course, they are important for maintaining physical health and staying fit.<br>
     Even though I don't always manage to make time—especially recently—I always strive and aim to do as much as I can.

		Another activity I enjoy doing in my free time, which also adds fun and enjoyment to my day,
        is playing video games.<br>
		Sometimes I play alone,and other times I play with my brothers.<br>
        I play various types of video games, mainly sports.
