	<h2>A bit about me...</h2>
	<p>
        Hello, my name is Daniel Gabay.<br>
        I am 22 years old and currently living in Holon, Israel.<br>
        After completing my high school studies, I began learning at a Hesder Yeshiva,<br>
        where I studied Torah for three years until the summer of 2024.<br>
        Currently, I am interested in the field of QA and automation.<br>
        Therefore, I am currently taking a course that will enable and help me<br>
        to obtain my first job in the field, as well as to grow and develop in all aspects related to it.<br>
		</p>
	<img src="images/daniel1.jpg" style="height:500px !important; width:auto !important;" />	
	<p>
		I am confident that I am well-suited for the QA field, largely thanks to various computer skills<br>
        I have acquired over the years. While these are currently basic skills, I know how to use them properly,<br>
        and I believe I can leverage these abilitiesâ€”along with the knowledge I gain from the courseâ€”<br>
        to succeed and grow in this field.
