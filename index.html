                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Gabay. I am 22 years old and currently living in Holon, Israel.</p>
                <p>After completing my high school studies, I began learning at a Hesder Yeshiva, where I studied Torah for three years until the summer of 2024.</p>
				<h2>So, why QA?</h2>
                <p>Currently, I am interested in the field of QA and automation. QA is known to be one of the more accessible entry points into the high-tech world, which is why I chose it — to develop my skills progressively.
				Therefore, I am currently taking a course that will enable and help me to obtain my first job in the field, as well as to grow and develop in all aspects related to it.</p>
                <p>I am confident that I am well-suited for the QA field, largely thanks to various computer skills I have acquired over the years. While these are currently basic skills, I know how to use them properly, and I believe I can leverage these abilities—along with the knowledge I gain from the course—to succeed and grow in this field.</p>
